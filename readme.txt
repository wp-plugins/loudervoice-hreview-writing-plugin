Allows you to easily insert correctly formatted LouderVoice reviews into your blog posts.

== Description ==

By using our plugin, your reviews are formatted using an open standard called hreview. This is a widely used approach to identifying the important parts of your review so that they can be interpreted correctly by a variety of websites. By using hreview you now have entirely portable reviews.

== Installation ==

1. Extract all files from the ZIP file, making sure to keep the file structure intact, and then upload it to /wp-content/plugins/ so that you end up with a structure like this:
	- wp-content
		- plugins
			- loudervoice-hreview-writing-plugin
				| loudervoice.css
				| loudervoice.end
				| loudervoice.js
				| loudervoice.php
				| readme.txt
				| reviewform.php
				- images

					| 3outof5.gif

2. If you'd prefer to have the itemname and stars at the end of the blog post along with the other hreview metadata, then replace loudervoice.php with loudervoice.end					
2. Activate the LouderVoice plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Settings -> LouderVoice menu and enter your LouderVoice username.

== Usage ==

1. First, make sure you've set up your LouderVoice username by going to the Settings -> LouderVoice Settings menu in WordPress.
2. To write a review, go to the Write -> Post menu and click the 'This is a review' checkbox at the top.
3. Some additional fields will appear which allow you to insert all your review information, such as the item name, URL and rating.
4. Your blog post will form the main body of your review.
5. If you wish to include location information (for example the address of a restaurant), click the 'Include location information' checkbox and enter the details in the relevant fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I edit my review once I've published it? =

Yes! Just edit your post in the normal manner and you'll be able to make changes to any part of your review from the post writing screen.

= Does this plugin support multiple authors on one blog? =

Yes! Each user can go to the Settings -> LouderVoice Settings menu and enter their own LouderVoice username. Note that the tag setting on that page is a global setting, however.
